\section*{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This project offers a full stack draft product for the UN Digital Library, which is a first step towards a more general approach, applicable to the whole UN Digital Library corpus. It contains a frontend, a graph database, an API, a machine learning pipeline to enhance the documents, a UN Digital Library API wrapper packaged as a Python library, a visualization of the UNBIS Thesaurus taxonomy.

Due to the reduced scope of the project, this can be seen as a basis for a larger work, which would include the improvement stated in the Discussion section (\ref{sec:discussion-future-work}).

The accent has been put on clean and documented code, maintainability, and the stack can easily been deployed, on a large scale, on a Kubernetes cluster since every service that compose it runs in a separate Docker container.

Special thanks to Catherine Pysden, Dr. El-Assady and Dr. Langenbach for their precious help and guidance throughout the project.
