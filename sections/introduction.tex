The \href{https://digitallibrary.un.org/}{United Nations Digital Library (UNDL)} is a United Nations (UN) service that provides public access to a diverse range of UN documents: voting data, speeches, maps, and open access publications starting from 1979.
Most of these documents have been classified according to the \href{https://metadata.un.org/thesaurus/about?lang=en}{UNBIS Thesaurus}, a multilingual database of the controlled vocabulary used to describe UN documents and other materials in the Library's collection, with a more or less precise topic label.


The main idea of this project is to create a full-stack analytics platform, with a network visualization of documents from a subset of the documents in the UN Digital Library. The analytics platform includes both Named Entity Recognition (NER) and summarization models to extract mentioned entities from the documents. The visualization part is a network visualization, leveraging the versatility of the structure of a graph to display the extracted insights. Both parts aim at improving the search of documents by implementing an analytics layer on top of the existing search engine from the digital library.
