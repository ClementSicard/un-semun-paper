In the short-term, the goal of this project is to provide a MVP of a potential future UN product, in close contact with UN staff to make it conform to their needs. Specifically, this project will focus – as a first iteration – on Catherine Pysden's suggestion, "Women in Peacekeeping".

The project's long-term scope is to be used as a search engine for UN staff, member-state delegates, and members of the general public with an interest in UN topics. Potential future work could include extending the project to the whole UN Digital Library. It could, for instance, also suggest Thesaurus-compliant metadata for untagged documents to facilitate the work of Library staff.
