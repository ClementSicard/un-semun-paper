\subsection{\texttt{un-unbis-thesaurus-scraper}: the UNBIS Thesaurus scraper} \label{ssec:un-unbis-thesaurus-scraper-the-unbis-thesaurus-scraper}

\repo{un-unbis-thesaurus-scraper} is a Python scraper that crawls the UNBIS Thesaurus website\footnote{\url{https://research.un.org/en/thesaurus}} and extracts the thesaurus terms and their relations. Once all the Thesaurus entries have been parsed, they are inserted with all their fields to the graph database instance (\ref{ssec:neo4j-graph-database}). All the HTTP request are made in parallel, and it takes a bit less than $4$ minutes to scrape the whole website.

It is mainly used to link Thesaurus topics the documents which are passed through the machine learning pipeline (\ref{ssec:un-ml-pipeline-the-machine-learning-pipeline}), but I felt it was also interesting to be able to visualize all the topics together and how they're related, so I built and deployed a small Vercel app to do so: \href{https://un-graph-ui.vercel.app/}{\faCloud{} \texttt{https://un-graph-ui.vercel.app/}}, which is built on a similar stack as the frontend (\ref{ssec:un-semun-front-a-react-sigma-js-frontend}).
