This repository contains scripts for the both the UN member states and the UN bodies: it first extracts the data from an Excel file and a CSV file respectively, then cleans it, and finally inserts it into the Neo4j database after having written a Cypher query. The scripts are written in Python and directly use the \texttt{neo4j} Python connector library.
