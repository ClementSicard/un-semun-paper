\texttt{un-semun} is a repository that englobes all other repositories as submodules. It also contains the \texttt{docker-compose} stack declaration, which points to Dockerfiles in submodules. They are updated using the \texttt{Makefile} when new commits are added to the submodules. The port forwardings and environment variables are also declared here. This is the main entry point to run the whole stack.
